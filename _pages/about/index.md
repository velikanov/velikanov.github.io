Hi there!

My name is Sergei Velikanov and I am a developer in broad sense of the term.<br />
My main area of expertise is Web development.

Currently I'm working as CTO.

I am [Zend Certified Engineer](https://www.zend.com/en/yellow-pages/ZEND030525) which makes me really effective in the
field of PHP development.<br />Currently I stick to [Symfony](http://symfony.com/) and [Spring](https://spring.io/)
frameworks.

From time to time I participate in and taking a part in hosting of professional conferences like 2016's Symfony Conf in
Moscow.

But my belief is that one doesn't have to stick to one gun to be perfect shooter.<br />
So with this idea in mind I'm constantly growing in adjacent development areas.

I am [Certified Blockchain Expert](https://www.credential.net/hafc5zkn) which I think is most important direction of
expertise for my future in development and programming.<br />
I stick to [Ethereum](https://www.ethereum.org/)'s [Solidity](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/) and the
[Truffle](http://truffleframework.com/) framework on this ground.

I'm running some private educational courses for corporate developers and taking a part in training and growing young
professionals in the Web development area.

I think that the world of development needs more confident programmers, more daring engineers.

And my mission is to provide developers full of hesitation about something new, with refreshing sense that development
world will not be truly effective and complete without their courage and drive hidden deep inside their minds.

I am sure that everything is possible, anything is reachable while you keep rocking really hard.

**Flexibility** over sedentary.

**Extensibility** over attachment.

**Achievement** over observation.

Thank you.
