    title: Get started with Java and Spring
    announcement: |
        This article is designed mostly for computer engineers with non-Java/Spring programming background who want to get
        started with new technology fast and flawlessly.

        Though it doesn’t cover most valuable principles in deployment, migrating and development, it can be used as good
        introductory view on new technology.

        I won’t explain every step of this guide deeply but will try to serve you with valuable links where you would get much more
        information.

        Throughout our journey we’ll build a simple Tube application which will crawl some videos from another website
        and present it on our website.
